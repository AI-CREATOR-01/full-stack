    "actual me this is the javascript framework not node.js because node.js is a runtime environment that help us to execute the JS code outside of web browser and by combining the power of node.js and express.js we can build backend, web app , appp etc\n",
    "\n",
    "1.so basically node.js is like a tool that allow us to use javascript on any computer not within the browser only mtlb agar       node.js nhi hota to kelw browser ke pass ability hai to execute the JS code mtlb agr hme JS use krni hai to kewl browser me kr   skte hai \n",

    "2.so finaly we can say that node.js allow us to use JS to perform many tasks but same task can be achieved easily if we use       framework like expreess rather than using vanilla JS \n",

    "3.so finally i can say that express.js use both node.js and javascript to make things easier and fast \n",

    "jo tasks hm express.js ki help se kr skte hai same kaam hm node(using pure/vanilla JS) se bhi kr skte hai but express.js make task much easier and more readable"
