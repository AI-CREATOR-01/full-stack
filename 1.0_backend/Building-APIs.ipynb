    "1. Node API\n",
    "   \n",
    "   fs module ,http module ya any core module ek  khud me software/application(logic and codes written in any progrtamming          language and stored in file/folder) hote hai and then we would be using them ya yu kahu ki we would be interacting with them    by using some piece of code associated with them jaise by using fs.readFile() to interact with fs systme/application etc\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. in case of object-oriented programming when exposing methods to the public , then we can say that we are creating API \n",
    "\n",
    "3. in case of nodes.js when we create/writes http methods and exposed their associated URL/endpointsa and mentioned/specify that    how other can format/trigger those URL/endpoint taaki client(an application) could interact with our server application ,        then we can say that we are creating API \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. whenever JS interact with html document then we would not writing JS at that time balki we would using DOM API privided by      web browser jaise ki document.getElementById(\"id_value\") then it is not JS balki it is an API ya yu kahu ki a piece of DOM      software/application\n",
