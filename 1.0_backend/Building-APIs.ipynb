    "2. in case of object-oriented programming when exposing methods to the public , then we can say that we are creating API \n",
    "\n",
    "3. in case of nodes.js when we create/writes http methods and exposed their associated URL/endpointsa and mentioned/specify that    how other can format/trigger those URL/endpoint taaki client(an application) could interact with our server application ,        then we can say that we are creating API \n",
